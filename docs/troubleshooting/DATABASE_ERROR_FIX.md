# Database Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The error "unexpected_failure" with message "Database error saving new user" was occurring during the sign-up process.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was related to the `handle_new_user` trigger function that automatically creates user profiles when new users sign up. The function lacked proper error handling and security configurations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Database Trigger Function
- **Updated Function**: `public.handle_new_user()`
- **Security**: Added `SECURITY DEFINER` and `SET search_path = public`
- **Error Handling**: Added proper exception handling with `ON CONFLICT` clause
- **Logging**: Added warning logs for debugging without blocking user creation

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Insert profile with better error handling
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, full_name, username, created_at, updated_at)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', ''),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'username', ''),
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  )
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
  
  RETURN NEW;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    -- Log the error but don't prevent user creation
    RAISE WARNING 'Failed to create profile for user %: %', NEW.id, SQLERRM;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

### 2. Enhanced Client-Side Error Handling
- **Improved Error Messages**: More specific error handling for different failure scenarios
- **Better User Feedback**: Clear toast notifications for each error type
- **Centralized Notifications**: Used centralized notification system for consistency
- **Debugging Support**: Added console logging for development

### 3. Added Comprehensive Error Categories
- Database errors
- User already exists
- Invalid email/password
- Sign-up disabled
- Username validation
- Unexpected errors

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/sign-up` route
2. Fill in the form with valid data
3. Submit the form
4. Verify successful account creation and profile creation

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check if user was created
SELECT id, email, created_at FROM auth.users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check if profile was created
SELECT id, username, full_name, created_at FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

### Edge Case Testing
1. Try signing up with an existing email
2. Try signing up with invalid email format
3. Try signing up with weak password
4. Try signing up with taken username

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Database Monitoring
- Monitor Supabase logs for any new database errors
- Check advisory notices regularly for security improvements
- Monitor profile creation success rate

### Error Tracking
- Client-side errors are logged to console in development
- Server-side errors are captured in Supabase logs
- User-facing errors show clear, actionable messages

## Security Improvements
- Fixed function search path security warnings
- Added proper SECURITY DEFINER context
- Implemented proper error handling that doesn't expose system details

## Performance Considerations
- Added small delay (500ms) after successful sign-up to ensure profile creation
- Used `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to handle race conditions
- Optimized error handling to not block user creation flow

## Future Enhancements
- Add automated retry logic for transient database errors
- Implement comprehensive logging system
- Add automated tests for sign-up flow
- Consider implementing email verification flow
