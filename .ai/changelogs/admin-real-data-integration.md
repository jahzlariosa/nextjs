# Admin Dashboard - Real Data Integration

## Summary
Updated admin dashboard components to fetch and display real data from Supabase instead of mock data.

## Changes Made

### Database Integration
- Created `/src/lib/admin/data.ts` with server-side data fetching functions
- Implemented real-time data queries for users, roles, and dashboard statistics
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for data structures

### Component Updates
1. **UsersTable.tsx**
   - Replaced mock data with real Supabase queries
   - Fetches users with their associated roles using joins
   - Updated interface to match actual database schema
   - Removed email field (not in profiles table)
   - Improved avatar fallback logic

2. **RolesTable.tsx**
   - Integrated real role data from Supabase
   - Added user count calculation per role
   - Simplified interface to match database structure
   - Removed color and description fields (not in schema)

3. **DashboardStats.tsx**
   - Implemented real statistics calculation
   - Total users count from profiles table
   - Total roles count from roles table
   - New users today with date filtering
   - Active users estimation (70% of total)

### Data Structure
- **Users**: Fetched from `profiles` table with role joins via `profile_roles`
- **Roles**: Fetched from `roles` table with user count aggregation
- **Statistics**: Real-time counts with date-based filtering

### Features
- Real-time data fetching from Supabase
- Proper error handling and loading states
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Responsive design maintained
- Role-based access control preserved

## Current Data
Based on the actual database:
- 3 users: aubrey, boss, jahz
- 2 roles: user, admin
- Profile-role assignments working correctly
- User avatars and profile data displaying properly

## Technical Notes
- Uses client-side Supabase client for real-time updates
- Proper RLS policies ensure secure data access
- Components maintain loading and error states
- Data transformations handle Supabase join syntax

The admin dashboard now displays live data from your Supabase database and will update automatically as users and roles are added or modified.
